= Spring Cloud Gateway - Customized Web Client

== Run the Sample

* Build the sample -> `gradlew clean build`
* Run UAA Server -> `gradlew -b uaa-server/build.gradle uaa`
* Run Gateway -> `gradlew -b gateway/build.gradle bootRun`
* Go to `http://localhost:8080` and login to UAA using *user1/password*

When you hit URL, http://localhost:8080/, the gateway will go through OAuth2 flow and finally show Test OK page. See the logs in Gateway project sample.log, you will find line

r.n.resources.PooledConnectionProvider   : [id: 0xe15dddf3, L:/127.0.0.1:62231 - R:localhost/127.0.0.1:8090] onStateChange(POST{uri=/uaa/oauth/token, connection=PooledConnection ...

That means the customization on WebClient used by Spring Security does not take effective on the reactor.netty.http.client.HttpClientConnect as it still use Pool.
